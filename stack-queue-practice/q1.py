"""
Create a queue class, outlining each method that should be implemented 
do not implement each method). Be sure to include a __init__ method. 
This is a question to test your general knowledge of how queues work, 
and what’s needed to implement them.

Implement enqueue and dequeue on the Queue class using a LinkedList. 
Assume you have a LinkedList class and all it’s typical methods.

Write a function that takes in a string that includes parentheses, 
and returns True or False depending on whether the parentheses in the string are 
balanced. Note: )(something) is not balanced, and (((something)) is not balanced.

Hint: Use a stack to keep track of parens.
Implement enqueue, dequeue, peek, and is_empty using a Python list.

Write a function called get_reverse_stack which takes a stack and returns a stack, 
which has all the same elements from the argument, but reversed.

Write a method on a Stack class (assuming you have other typical Stack methods and attributes) called get_max which determines and returns the maximum value in a Stack. You can assume the Stack elements are integers.
